# dataproc
R package of data processing and other misc. functions.

This package may be helpful to you if you have to process data before analysis and have issues such as: you spelled "yes" (Yes, yes, y, present, etc.), "no" (No, no, none, 0, etc.), and "NA" (Not recorded, Not Recorded, NA, 999, etc.) many different ways and need to standardize the data. 

This package is very much in its infancy so better documentation will be coming soon.

Also, if know of an R package (or functions) out there that already do some of these tasks, please let me know!
